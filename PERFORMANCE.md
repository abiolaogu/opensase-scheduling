# PERFORMANCE

## Phase 2 Deep Audit Snapshot
- Repo: /Users/AbiolaOgunsakin1/opensase-migration/repos/opensase-scheduling
- Vertical: Core Platform
- Primary Language: Rust
- Heuristic Risk Score: 34 (low)
- Potential Polling References: 25
- Potential N+1 / inefficient query references: 9
- Potential Sync I/O references: 0
- Potential CPU hot-path indicators: 0

## Baseline Commands
- Build/validate: `cargo check --all-targets`
- Benchmark/profiling: `cargo bench (or criterion harness)`

## Bottleneck Hypotheses
1. High-frequency polling and timer loops can produce unnecessary CPU/network pressure.
2. Query/loop hotspots may amplify latency under tenant scale.
3. Missing targeted benchmarks hides regressions until late-stage deployment.

## Immediate Remediation Plan
1. Replace high-rate polling with Pulsar event subscriptions where feasible.
2. Introduce targeted benchmark cases for top 3 critical code paths.
3. Instrument p95/p99 latency and queue lag with Quickwit-indexed traces/logs.

## Stack Evolution Recommendation
Optimize existing stack with OTel + Pulsar + Quickwit contracts

## X+1 Innovation Target
Tenant-aware autonomous operations assistant with policy recommendations

## SLO and Guardrails
- Availability target: 99.9%
- p95 latency target: service-specific SLO in RUNBOOK
- Error budget policy: monthly review
- DLQ, retry, idempotency must remain enforced in Pulsar contracts
